# 🎭 Welcome to My Digital Stage

> _“Websites aren’t just code — they’re tiny universes, each telling a story.”_

Hello, curious traveler! 🌍 You've just stumbled upon the source code of my **portfolio website** — a handcrafted blend of pixels, passion, and just a pinch of caffeine.

This isn’t just a homepage.  
It’s my **canvas**, my **code dojo**, my **corner of the internet** where creativity meets `<div>`s.

## 🧪 Ingredients

Like any good recipe, this site is made with love and:

- `HTML` – The bones 🦴
- `CSS` – The wardrobe 👗
- `JavaScript` – The personality 🤖

No frameworks, no libraries. Just raw, artisanal front-end magic.

## 🧭 Why This Exists

Because resumes are boring.  
Because creativity shouldn’t be confined to a PDF.  
Because I needed a space that’s **100% me**, and this site is it.

## 💡 Behind the Scenes

Every line of code here was written with care.  
Every color chosen on purpose.  
Every animation thoughtfully timed.  

Why? Because details matter. And this site is my love letter to the web.
